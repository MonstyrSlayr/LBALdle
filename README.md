# LBALdle
LBALdle is a combination of [Luck Be a Landlord](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1404850/Luck_be_a_Landlord/), the deckbuilder rougelike strategy game, and Wordle, the popular word guessing game. Guess the symbol based on the clues given!

This game takes heavy inspiration from [Squirdle](https://squirdle.fireblend.com), the Pok√©mon Wordle variant.
